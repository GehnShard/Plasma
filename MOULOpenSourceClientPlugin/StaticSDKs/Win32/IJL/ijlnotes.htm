<A NAME="Overview"><h2>Intel® JPEG Library 1.51</h2>
</A><P>The Intel® JPEG Library (IJL) is a software library for application developers that provides high performance JPEG encoding and decoding of full color and grayscale still
images.</P>
<P>The IJL was designed for use on Intel® architecture platforms and has been tuned for speed and efficient memory usage. Additionally, the IJL was developed to take advantage of MMX™,
Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE), and SSE-2 technology if
present.</P>
<P>The IJL provides an easy-to-use programming interface without sacrificing low-level JPEG control to advanced developers. The IJL also includes a substantial amount of functionality that is not included in the ISO JPEG standard. This added functionality is typically necessary when working with JPEG images, and includes pre-processing and post-processing options like sampling and color space conversions.</P>
<P>Additional information on this software as well as other libraries is
available at the <a href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/perflib/">Intel Performance
Libraries web site</a>.<br>
</P>
<h2><A NAME="System_Requirements">System Requirements</h2>
</A>
<P>The Intel  JPEG Library requires the following software and hardware:</P>
<P>Recommended hardware: A Pentium&reg; II,&nbsp; Pentium <font face="Arial">III</font>, or Pentium 4 processor-based PC with memory appropriate to the image sizes needed.</P>
<P>Software Requirements: Microsoft* Windows* 95, 98, ME*, 2000, or Microsoft Windows NT* 3.51 or 4.0.</P>
<h2><a name="Compilers">Compiler Support</a></h2>
<P>Intel&reg; C++ Compiler, Borland* C++ 5, or Microsoft* Visual C++* 4.2 or
later. Other compatible compilers have not been tested extensively but might work.</P>
<h2><A NAME="License_Definitions">License Definitions</h2>
</A>
<P>Please see the license file <a href="ijllic.htm">ijllic.htm</a>
for the license definitions and restrictions on the library.</P>
<h2><A NAME="Installation">Installation</h2>
</A>
<P>You can install the IJL package by downloading and running the appropriate self-extracting installation files from the Web site.
Check the <a href="http://developer.intel.com/software/products/perflib/ijl/">Intel JPEG
Library</a> site for updates, when available.</P>
<h2><A NAME="Library_Use">Library Use</A></h2><P>To get started using the library, the following steps are required:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Include the file &quot;ijl.h&quot; in your program. </LI>
<LI>Call the IJL interface. </LI>
<LI>Link to the file ijl.lib in the lib directory. </LI>
<LI>Put the DLL ijl15.dll in your path before executing your program.</LI></UL>
