//	plWAVClipBuffer - Helper class for writing out WAV data in a buffered	//
//					  manner, with support for clipping off the specified	//
//					  amount at the end, but without knowing beforehand		//
//					  exactly how much data we'll have.						//
//																			//
//	The algorithm goes something like this: we keep two buffers, both the	//
//	size of the amount we want to clip. We then start filling in the first	//
//	buffer, overflowing into the second buffer and wrapping back to the		//
//	first again in a circular fashion. When we fill up one buffer and are	//
//	about to advance to the next, we write that next buffer out. Why?		//
//	Because we know that, even if we got no more data in, we have enough	//
//	data in the first buffer to clip out the amount we want, so the other	//
//	half (which will have older data, being a circular buffer) can be		//
//	written out safely.														//

// 1) We haven't received enough data to clip by, at which point we don't
// write any more and bail (this will be true if fFirstFlip is still true)
//
// 2) Our cursor is at 0, which means we have one filled buffer that hasn't been
// written out and our current buffer is empty. At this point, we discard the
// filled buffer (which is precisely the length we want to clip by) and we're done.
//
// 3) The buffer we're on should be partially filled, while the other one is older 
// data. So, we want to write out the older data and the partial buffer all the way,
// except for the clip size. Since we can therefore never write out any data in the
// partial buffer (since that count will always be less than the clip size and thus be
// the second half of what we clip), we simply figure out how much of the other one we
