# State Description Language for a LoadClone message
# Currently only used by the gameserver to store a loadClone msg as dynamic object state
#

#
# This is the only SDL file allowed to use the "CREATABLE" type. Normally that type is
# a security hole. We can't guarantee that trying to read a creatable on an arbitrary
# (i.e. hacked) stream won't crash the game. However, since this state is generated by the 
# server, we can trust that.
