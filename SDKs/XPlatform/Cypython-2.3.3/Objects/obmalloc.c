/*
 * Allocation strategy abstract:
 *
 * For small requests, the allocator sub-allocates <Big> blocks of memory.
 * Requests greater than 256 bytes are routed to the system's allocator.
 *
 * Small requests are grouped in size classes spaced 8 bytes apart, due
 * to the required valid alignment of the returned address. Requests of
 * a particular size are serviced from memory pools of 4K (one VMM page).
 * Pools are fragmented on demand and contain free lists of blocks of one
 * particular size class. In other words, there is a fixed-size allocator
 * for each size class. Free pools are shared by the different allocators
 * thus minimizing the space reserved for a particular size class.
 *
 * This allocation strategy is a variant of what is known as "simple
 * segregated storage based on array of free lists". The main drawback of
 * simple segregated storage is that we might end up with lot of reserved
 * memory for the different free lists, which degenerate in time. To avoid
 * this, we partition each free list in pools and we share dynamically the
 * reserved space between all free lists. This technique is quite efficient
 * for memory intensive programs which allocate mainly small-sized blocks.
 *
 * For small requests we have the following table:
 *
 * Request in bytes	Size of allocated block      Size class idx
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *        1-8                     8                       0

/*
 * Pool table -- headed, circular, doubly-linked lists of partially used pools.

This is involved.  For an index i, usedpools[i+i] is the header for a list of
all partially used pools holding small blocks with "size class idx" i. So
usedpools[0] corresponds to blocks of size 8, usedpools[2] to blocks of size
16, and so on:  index 2*i <-> blocks of size (i+1)<<ALIGNMENT_SHIFT.

Pools are carved off the current arena highwater mark (file static arenabase)
as needed.  Once carved off, a pool is in one of three states forever after:

used == partially used, neither empty nor full
    At least one block in the pool is currently allocated, and at least one
    block in the pool is not currently allocated (note this implies a pool
    has room for at least two blocks).
    This is a pool's initial state, as a pool is created only when malloc
    needs space.
    The pool holds blocks of a fixed size, and is in the circular list headed
    at usedpools[i] (see above).  It's linked to the other used pools of the
    same size class via the pool_header's nextpool and prevpool members.
    If all but one block is currently allocated, a malloc can cause a
    transition to the full state.  If all but one block is not currently
    allocated, a free can cause a transition to the empty state.

full == all the pool's blocks are currently allocated
    On transition to full, a pool is unlinked from its usedpools[] list.
    It's not linked to from anything then anymore, and its nextpool and
    prevpool members are meaningless until it transitions back to used.
    A free of a block in a full pool puts the pool back in the used state.
    Then it's linked in at the front of the appropriate usedpools[] list, so
    that the next allocation for its size class will reuse the freed block.

empty == all the pool's blocks are currently available for allocation
    On transition to empty, a pool is unlinked from its usedpools[] list,
    and linked to the front of the (file static) singly-linked freepools list,
    via its nextpool member.  The prevpool member has no meaning in this case.
    Empty pools have no inherent size class:  the next time a malloc finds
    an empty list in usedpools[], it takes the first pool off of freepools.
    If the size class needed happens to be the same as the size class the pool
    last had, some pool initialization can be skipped.


Block Management

Blocks within pools are again carved out as needed.  pool->freeblock points to
the start of a singly-linked list of free blocks within the pool.  When a
block is freed, it's inserted at the front of its pool's freeblock list.  Note
that the available blocks in a pool are *not* linked all together when a pool
is initialized.  Instead only "the first two" (lowest addresses) blocks are
set up, returning the first such block, and setting pool->freeblock to a
one-block list holding the second such block.  This is consistent with that
pymalloc strives at all levels (arena, pool, and block) never to touch a piece
of memory until it's actually needed.

So long as a pool is in the used state, we're certain there *is* a block
available for allocating, and pool->freeblock is not NULL.  If pool->freeblock
points to the end of the free list before we've carved the entire pool into
blocks, that means we simply haven't yet gotten to one of the higher-address
blocks.  The offset from the pool_header to the start of "the next" virgin
block is stored in the pool_header nextoffset member, and the largest value
of nextoffset that makes sense is stored in the maxnextoffset member when a
pool is initialized.  All the blocks in a pool have been passed out at least
once when and only when nextoffset > maxnextoffset.


Major obscurity:  While the usedpools vector is declared to have poolp
entries, it doesn't really.  It really contains two pointers per (conceptual)
poolp entry, the nextpool and prevpool members of a pool_header.  The
excruciating initialization code below fools C so that

    usedpool[i+i]

"acts like" a genuine poolp, but only so long as you only reference its
nextpool and prevpool members.  The "- 2*sizeof(block *)" gibberish is
compensating for that a pool_header's nextpool and prevpool members
immediately follow a pool_header's first two members:

	union { block *_padding;
		uint count; } ref;
	block *freeblock;

each of which consume sizeof(block *) bytes.  So what usedpools[i+i] really
contains is a fudged-up pointer p such that *if* C believes it's a poolp
pointer, then p->nextpool and p->prevpool are both p (meaning that the headed
circular list is empty).

It's unclear why the usedpools setup is so convoluted.  It could be to
minimize the amount of cache required to hold this heavily-referenced table
(which only *needs* the two interpool pointer members of a pool_header). OTOH,
referencing code has to remember to "double the index" and doing so isn't
free, usedpools[0] isn't a strictly legal pointer, and we're crucially relying
on that C doesn't insert any padding anywhere in a pool_header at or before
the prevpool member.
